### An un-named mining game
This project is developed with the [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/) framework using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as the programming language. 

This project will probably never be fully finished, but there will be a few cool features! 
Such as (features in italics are planned/wip):
- custom rigidbodies
- *entities & components (with in-game editor?)*
- *lua x html & scss UI*

I plan on turning this project into a simple mining game with linear progression, and some exploration aspects...

### Setting up locally
1. Install [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/), preferably as zip.
2. You drag this folder onto the `love.exe` or `lovec.exe`.

You can also setup launch commands, etc... go nuts!
